## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security issue please contact us privately at [contact@convos.chat](mailto:contact@convos.chat) with a detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, logs and screenshots are very helpful to us).

When we receive a vulnerability report, we would need some time to:
- Confirm the problem and assess severity.
- Check the code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes and coordinate a release. 

Please allow at least 30 days before disclosure.
