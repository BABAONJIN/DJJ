title: Create your own theme in minutes !
---

In Convos [v4.xx](https://convos.chat/blog/2020/5/14/theming-support-in-4-point-oh.html) it is super easy to customize
or create a theme.  Follow this detailed walkthrough written by [Thibault Duponchelle](https://github.com/thibaultduponchelle) on how to create a **"hack3r"** theme ! 

<!--more-->


## Smooth start

You have to go to your server where convos is running or you can do this tutorial locally : 

`cd $CONVOS_HOME/themes`

For you informations, `$CONVOS_HOME` is where convos puts all user settings and user themes. See [FAQ](https://convos.chat/doc/faq.html#where-does-convos-store-logs-settings-and-uploaded-files).

Then a good way to start is to copy paste an existing theme, choose wisely the one that is the simplest and closest to what you want to achieve :

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nordaaker/convos/master/public/themes/high-contrast_color-scheme-light.css > mytheme.css`

(here I chose light version of hight-contrast, would have been smarter to choose a dark version)

The name of your file is not important, the theme name will be included in the header of the CSS file.

`$EDITOR mytheme.css`

Choose your theme name :

    /*
     * name: Hacker 
    */ 

When you go to your convos instance settings, you will already be able to select your new theme (maybe you will need to
refresh your page) :

We created our theme, and switched to it. At the moment, our new theme is a vanilla copy of `high-contrast light` but it's
a start and we can now play with it (and it will be reflected in our convos in almost real time).

**It is very easy to develop a new theme because without even having to restart convos, your changes are immediately
viewable !!!**

If it is your first theme, I recommend a light theme (bg light and text dark), it is easier.


## How do I choose the colors ?

Honestly I first started by typing **"hacker theme green"** in [google image](https://www.google.com/search?q=hacker+theme+green&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjljK2Zwc_pAhUMHBoKHU3MDPQQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=hacker+theme+green&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoCCCk6BAgAEBM6AggAOgQIABAeOgYIABAIEB5QnwlYhxVgmRdoAXAAeACAAWaIAfQEkgEDNS4ymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=V_zLXqWFE4y4aM2Ys6AP&bih=771&biw=1533&client=ubuntu&hs=Vge&safe=active) and I looked at results.

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-google.png)

It gave me an idea about what colors to put together : 
* First the green is really flashy, letâ€™s go for flashy then.
* There is black background or eventually dark grey background. In my mind I was thinking 
  *"cool, I will try to put this grey on one panel !"* because 
  usually don't like having all convos panel the same color
* Text colors are usually green or grey

To have the color of the grey used in one of the screenshots (the grey in the treeview renders well with overall black
bg) :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-grey.png)

I use the *"eye dropper"* from [The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-gimp.png)

I used it to click magically on the color that I needed to know the value...

...And I get the html notation `#181818` that you will see later in the CSS : 

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-htmlnotation.png)


## Panel backgrounds 

Ok let's start changing the colors. 

It is a **hacker** theme, it has to be daaark ! 

Therefore I wanted to put black on left/mid panel and grey on right panel... I was actually not sure about how to
arrange this, I made some tests and I finally used black everywhere !

Then look at our first modification.

    /* Backgrounds */ 
    --sidebar-left-bg: black; 
    --body-bg: black; 
    --sidebar-right-bg: black;

I can use color shortcuts names (`black`) or hex values (`#RRGGBB` from `#000000` to `#ffffff`)

You can use for instance an [online color picker](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-reference/html-color-picker.php) to find colors
values or shades. 

Let's imagine "I want a green like this one but darker" you can type the current green value in the color picker and
choose another level of shade.

## Edit text colors 

Having such dark barckground immediatly revealed text color issues. 

On the left I will use a **hacker's green**, on the right a grey and in the middle a light green with higher contrast.

    /* Text color */
    --text-color: #77ff77; /* The body text color (mid panel) */
    --sidebar-right-text: #666666; /* Text color on right panel */
    --sidebar-left-text: green; /* Color of rooms when connected (selected or not) */

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-textcolor.png)


## Links

Next we can change the links color (send button, upload file, settings) to green (it is the hacker color that we will
use with dark shades) : 

    --link-color: green;

will produce :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-l1.png)

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-l2.png)

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-l3.png)

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-l4.png)

Next, the highlight when you are mentionned. I will choose a red to hightlight when someone talk to me : 

    --highlight-color-bg: #990000;

I do not use `red` color name because it is too flashy.

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-hl.png)


## Left side panel

We will try to put a lot of green here.

The more important here will be the shadow around the room when selected.

It is achieved with ` --focus-outline: 0 0 3px 3px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5);` where the *rgba* is clearly "give me a shadow
of green".

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-shadow.png)

Then I set the `--sidebar-left-border: 1px solid black;` (which is an invisible border between left panel and mid panel.  

Then I set the `--sidebar-left-search-focus-bg: transparent;` so that there will be no background, only a shadow around.

I continue with `--sidebar-left-frozen-color: #003300;` that is what you can see when you're not connected to a room
(server does not exists or you're actually in the process of connecting to irc).

To give you a demo, I started a connection to an server that does not exist (efff-*too-much-f*-net) :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-frozen.png)

You can also disconnect from a server by disabling the connection in the settings :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-disco.png)

And you get the same *"frozen"* effect :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-disconnected.png)


I will also change the color of left panel separator : 

    --sidebar-left-border-bottom: #003300;

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-hr.png)

With this setup, we have now a nice left panel :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-left.png)

## Buttons

Now play with buttons. My goal is to do a green button with white or black or red text (depends what looks best) and
when clicked appears darker.

I start with `--button-bg: green;` and `--button-color: #181818;` to have this :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-button1.png)

Border is hidden with `--button-border: 1px solid black;`

For the disabled button I set something like this :

    --button-disabled-bg: #002200;
    --button-disabled-border: 1px solid #002200; /* The border of a disabled button */
    --button-focus-outline: 1px solid #006600;
    --button-disabled-color: #006600;


How to choose the color for disabled button ?

Testing...

But I can give you some hints : 
* Use the shader discussed earlier
* And use darker shade on dark theme and lighter shade on light theme (darker or lighter shade compared to non disabled
  button).

Here the winning text/bg color duo is a light green for the background and a green for the text.

The disabled appears when a button is not clickable then both when disabled or when clicked (for as short period).

Now I now have this buttons : 

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-buttons.png)


## Right panel

On the right the nicknames need some customization then I changed their color to grey : 

    --sidebar-right-text: #181818;

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-rightgrey.png)


## Various

I will also change the conversation separator to make it dashed and green : 

    --hr-border: 1px dashed green;

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-sep.png)

And I set the background color of `code` tag to red with `--code-bg: red;`

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-code.png)


## Inputs 

I want also to add some sugar to my input focus to add a small green border, a dotter border when theyr are clicked and
a light grey placholder text color : 


    /* Inputs */
    --input-focus-outline: 1px dotted green;
    --input-bg: #181818;
    --input-color: #009900;
    --input-border: 1px solid green;


It will produce :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-input1.png)

and 

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-input2.png)


Finally I added `--chat-input-bg: #181818;` to improve chat input box color :

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-chatinput.png)


## Listbox 

Listbox will use the style from input section but requires also some more customization.

With the following CSS, I can set 

    /* Listbox */
    --autocomplete-bg: #181818;
    --autocomplete-border: 1px solid #888;
    --autocomplete-focus-bg: green;


![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-listbox.png)


## Conclusion 

Here is the final result :

and 

![](/public/screenshots/2020-05-26-settings.png)

And the CSS code :


    /*
     * name: Hacker
     */
    
    :root {
    
      /* Backgrounds */
      --sidebar-left-bg: black;
      --body-bg: black;
      --sidebar-right-bg: black;
      
    
      /* Text color */

      --sidebar-right-text: #666666; /* Text color on right panel */
      --sidebar-left-text: green; /* Color of rooms when connected (selected or not) */
    
      /* The bakground when someone mentions you */
      --highlight-color-bg: #990000;
    
      /* Left panel */
      --sidebar-left-border: 1px solid black; /* Separator between left panel, can generally be ignored */
      --sidebar-left-border-bottom: #003300; /* Separator below "conversation" or "email" */
      --sidebar-left-frozen-color: #003300; /* Color of rooms when not connected */
      --sidebar-left-search-focus-bg: transparent; /* The background of the room name selected */
      --focus-outline: 0 0 3px 3px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5); /* Big shadow when selected */

      --button-disabled-color: #006600;
    
      /* Various */

      --input-disabled-bg: #181818;
      --input-disabled-color: #009900;
      --input-placeholder-color: #009900;
      --input-focus-placeholder-color: #bbb;
    
      /* Keep as is */
      --error-color: #ee2222;
      --success-color: #338833;
      --syntax-hl-base-bg: #fff;
      
      /* Listbox */
      --autocomplete-bg: #181818;
      --autocomplete-border: 1px solid #888;
      --autocomplete-focus-bg: green;
    
    }
    
    
## Tips and tricks

* Everything you don't define is inherited
* Only some vars can be overriden, to know which one, check other themes, try some obvious names or check into [`*.scss`
  files](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/blob/master/assets/sass/_variables.scss). If missing, you can [ask to add them](https://convos.chat/doc/#get-in-touch).
* The help page proposes some demo page, it is very convenient to test all pages (even the one that print not usually
  like 404)
* Light theme is easier for beginners because there are few variables to customize (do not need to set input backgrounds
  for instance).
