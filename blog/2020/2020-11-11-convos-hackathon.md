Interested in hacking on Convos and learning more about the design?

We will have a hackathon on 21st of November 07:00 JST, until 21:00 JST. Jan
Henning Thorsen (batman) will be active in the #convos channel on
irc.freenode.net, answering questions and teaming up on different components
that *you* want to build.

Please [contact](mailto:contact@convos.chat) us if you want to attend with the
following information:

* Your nickname on irc.freenode.net.
* At what time you can join, including timezone information.
* Which part of Convos do you want to hack on: Frontend, backend, plugins or
  other bugs/components/features.
* Other relevant information you can think of.

Because of timezones, there won't be any fixed schedule, but we might do
ad-hoc video conference using [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/),
[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or [Whereby](https://whereby.com/convos-hack).

Please have a look at the following resources before joining:

* [Convos developement guide](https://convos.chat/doc/develop)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Perl](https://docs.mojolicious.org/#BASICS)

Don't know what to hack on, but interested in helping anyways? Maybe you can
improve the documentation for either on the official website or inside the
Convos application. Discuss how onboarding (creating a new account) could be
more user friendly. Creating new
[themes](https://convos.chat/blog/2020/6/14/create-your-own-theme-detailed-walkthrough)
are also welcome, or extending the set of variables to make your theme possible
to build.

We also have open [issues](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues) and
there are also some ideas put into the
[fridge](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues?q=milestone%3AFridge) which
would be cool to get done.

Looking forward to talking to you on the 21st!
